This actually runs in a jupyter notebook inside jupyter lab.
there are 2 history files since I had a terminal open with 2 tabs
the second tab history2.out is where I installed Jupyter and launched it
The first tab is where I ran pip commands to install libraries.
the other 3 files represent 3 cells in the notebook
1.  llmAndTool
2.  toolRun
3.  Chat
